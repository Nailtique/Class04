LISTS
X There are three types of HTML lists: ordered, 
unordered, and definition. 
X Ordered lists use numbers.
X Unordered lists use bullets.
X Definition lists are used to define terminology.
X Lists can be nested inside one another




the lists makes our life easier, gives the page beauty, with few commands like - it gives the page more of an order lines Links are the defining feature of the web
because they allow you to move from
one web page to another — enabling the
very idea of browsing or surfing.
You will commonly come across the following types of links:
Links f ●● rom one website to another
●● Links from one page to another on the same website
●● Links from one part of a web page to another part of the
same page
●● Links that open in a new browser window
●● Links that start up your email program and address a new
email to someone
in the link people can scan it and navigate the website through it 

An Example on both linkinig to outside website and listing :

<p>Movie Reviews:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.empireonline.com">
Empire</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.metacritic.com">
Metacritic</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com">
Rotten Tomatoes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.variety.com">
Variety</a></li>
</ul>
</p>

When you are linking to other
pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the
domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a
relative URL.which are a shorthand way to tell
the browser where a page is in
relation to the current page

it is the same when we want to send to an Email : Mail to - and youplace the target Email

If you want to link to a specific
part of a different page (whether
on your own site or a different
website) you can use a similar
technique.
As long as the page you are
linking to has id attributes that
identify specific parts of the
page, you can simply add the
same syntax to the end of the
link for that page.

Java script book : Chapter 3 

A script is made up of a series of statements. Each 
statement is like a step in a recipe. 
Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example, 
you might specify that a value must be remembered 
before creating a calculation using that value. 
Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of 
information used in the script. 
Arrays are special types of variables that store more 
than one piece of related information. 
JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9), 
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 
Expressions evaluate into a single value. 
Expressions rely on operators to calculate a value.
